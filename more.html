        <h1>Iwama Ryu</h1>
        <p>Iwama Aikido is practiced at the Kapiti Aikido Dojo.
          Iwama Ryu refers the style of Aikido that was taught by Saito Morihiro Sensei.
          Saito Sensei was one of Master Ueshiba’s top students, living alongside and training with 
          the master for 23 years. Upon Master Ueshiba’s death, Saito Sensei became the caretaker 
          of the Aiki Shrine and the Dojo-cho of Ibaragi Aiki Dojo in Iwama, Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saito Sensei (9th Dan) traveled around the world teaching Aikido, as taught to him by Master
          Ueshiba, striving to preserve the techniques of the founder. He passed away on 13 May 2002.
        </p>
        <p>
          His son, Saito Hitohiro Sensei, like his father, is dedicated to teaching the Aikido of the founder
          during his years in Iwama. Other notable Sensei who have influenced the aikido taught at Kapiti
          Aikido have been Daniel Toutain Sensei (France/Europe) and Patricia Hendricks Sensei (USA).
        </p>

        <h1>The Founder of Aikido</h1>
        <p>
          Master Ueshiba, the founder of modern Aikido, was born in Tanabe, Japan, on 14 December
          1883. His life was devoted to the traditional Budo arts of Japan. He became a very strong, skilled
          and revered martial artist. After becoming concerned with the meaning and objectives of the arts
          he had mastered, Master Ueshiba established that true self-defense was not winning over others,
          but winning over the discord within oneself. Through his efforts Aikido was developed as a way to
          divert harm from oneself, whilst not needing to inflict serious injury on an aggressor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Master Ueshiba left behind him an art and philosophy rich in spirit and kindness. He passed on in
          Iwama, Japan, on April 26 1969 at the age of 86.
        </p>

        <h1>Aikido Training</h1>

        <h2>Taijutsu</h2>
        <p>
          <i>Taijutsu</i> is body training where you learn to defend against unarmed attacks from 
          one or more attackers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aikido techniques range from restraining and pinning techniques to throwing techniques.
        </p>

        <h2>Bukiwaza</h2>
        <p>
          <i>Bukiwaza</i> is the practice of weapon techniques. Aikido weapons training consists of
          <i>Aiki-Ken</i> and <i>Aiki-Jo</i> techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          Weapons training is an integral part of Aikido as it teaches the correct body posture for <i>taijutsu</i>
          techniques, and develops overall body strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the practice of <i>Aiki-Ken</i>, Aikidoka use a <i>bokken</i> (wooden sword),which is approximately 100cm
          in length and similar in shape to a <i>katana</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Aiki-Ken</i> has seven basic movements called <i>suburi</i>, and many blending practices called <i>awase</i>,
          which lead into the practice of <i>Kumi-Tachi</i> (paired practice).
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Aiki-Jo</i> (wooden staff) approximately 2.5cm in diameter and 130cm in length is used in the practice
          of <i>Aiki-Jo</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Aiki-Jo</i> has twenty basic movements (<i>suburi</i>). <i>Aiki-Jo</i> also has two katas, which are practiced
          alone first, and then with a partner. This practice leads into the practice of <i>Kumi-Jo</i> (paired
          practices).
